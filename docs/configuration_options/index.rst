Configuration Options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The TOML configuration file serves as the primary interface for user input in DeepH-pack. This section details how to construct these files for both training and inference workflows. It provides a comprehensive reference for all available options, explaining their purpose, accepted values, and effects on model behavior.

These guides are structured to help new users establish a working configuration from templates, while also serving as a detailed specification for advanced users who need to fine-tune hyperparameters or adapt the framework to specific use cases.
