## Core Features & Basic Usage

The [modernized DeepH-pack](https://ticket.deeph-pack.com) is built upon the [solid foundation of its predecessor](https://github.com/mzjb/DeepH-pack) and has been re-engineered with [JAX](https://github.com/jax-ml/jax) and [FLAX](https://github.com/google/flax) to unlock new levels of efficiency and flexibility.

***Further online documentation will be available soon!***
